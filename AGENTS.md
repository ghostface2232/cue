# Cue
 
Cue is a Windows-native to-do app. Its basic interface takes its references from Things 3 and Todoist, while the bar for interface completion and microinteraction quality is the files-community Files app. Korean is a first-class input language. The name reflects the core mechanic: you type a single line, and it cues the next action, parsing the due date, time, and priority out of plain text.

## Project status
 
Foundation phase. The app is single-device and local-first right now. Multi-device sync, reminders, and full visual polish are deliberately out of scope for now, but the architecture is built so they can be added later without a rewrite. Build incrementally and verify each step. Do not try to implement everything at once.
 
## Tech stack
 
- WinUI (Windows App SDK 2.0). This is a native UI framework, not a webview wrapper. Use Fluent Design, Mica/Acrylic materials, and native composition animations.
- C# on .NET 10 (LTS, supported through 2028-11-10). Target framework moniker is of the form `net10.0-windows10.0.26100.0`.
- MVVM via `CommunityToolkit.Mvvm` (use the source generators: `[ObservableProperty]`, `[RelayCommand]`).
- Persistence source of truth: one JSON file per record, serialized with `System.Text.Json`.
- Query index: SQLite via `Microsoft.Data.Sqlite`. Do not use EF Core; the index is a lightweight derived cache.
- Natural-language date parsing: `Microsoft.Recognizers.Text.DateTime` with `Culture.Korean`.
- Packaging: unpackaged or external-location packaged. Rationale: the app must read and write user-chosen cloud folders (OneDrive, Google Drive) in a later phase, so avoid the MSIX virtual filesystem constraints.
## Tooling and commands
 
- Dev loop: `dotnet run` or `winapp run`. Primary editor is VS Code with the WinApp extension. Visual Studio 2026 is optional, not required.
- winapp CLI: `winapp init` (adds package identity and manifest), `winapp run` (build-and-launch, the command-line equivalent of F5), `winapp ui` (inspect and drive the running UI for verification), `winapp pack` (package for distribution).
- For current WinUI APIs, query the Microsoft Learn MCP server rather than relying on training data. WinUI APIs shift between releases, and note the current naming: WinUI 3 is now referred to simply as WinUI, and the old WinUI 2 is WinUI for UWP.
- A Claude Code WinUI plugin is available and recommended: `/plugin install winui@awesome-copilot`.
## Architecture
 
One rule governs everything: files are the source of truth, and SQLite is a disposable, rebuildable index. Never make SQLite the source of truth, and never treat a single monolithic database file as the synced unit. A future cloud-folder sync depends on the truth being granular per-record files.
 
Layers, with dependencies pointing top-down only:
 
```
View (XAML)
   -> ViewModel (MVVM)
        -> Store (ITaskStore, the single write path)
             -> file folder  = source of truth ({guid}.json per record)
             -> SQLite        = derived query index
   -> Parser service (IDateParser), standalone
   -> [future] Sync module that watches the folder
```
 
Write flow: an input line goes through the parser, becomes a record, is saved through `ITaskStore.Save`, which writes `{guid}.json` and updates the SQLite index, after which the ViewModel refreshes.
 
Read flow: every query (Today, Upcoming, by project, by label, completed/incomplete filters, title and notes search) hits the SQLite index. Never scan the file folder directly for queries.
 
## Data model (sync-ready by design)
 
Domain types are pure C# with zero knowledge of persistence: `TaskItem`, `Project`, `Section`, `Label`. The hierarchy is Project contains TaskItems (optionally grouped under a Section), and Label is cross-cutting. A task's container is a single nullable `ProjectId`; null means unclassified (free). An Area level above Project is intentionally deferred for the foundation phase — it can be added later as an additive record type plus an optional `Project.AreaId`, with no rewrite.
 
Every record carries these fields from day one:

- `Id` (GUID)
- `CreatedAt`
- `UpdatedAt`
- `DeletedAt` (tombstone for soft delete; null means alive)
- `SchemaVersion` (int)

Records compare by **identity**: two instances are equal when they are the same concrete type with the same `Id` (exact `GetType()` match), and the hash is over the immutable, init-only `Id` only. Because equality is Id-only it cannot tell whether content changed — a local record and an incoming synced one with the same Id are "equal" even if every other field differs. Index refresh and sync reconciliation must therefore compare `UpdatedAt` (or specific fields), never `old.Equals(new)`.

Timestamps and user dates are stored differently:

- System timestamps — `CreatedAt`, `UpdatedAt`, `CompletedAt` — are UTC instants only; a timezone carries no meaning for them.
- Every user-chosen scheduled date — a task's When date, a task's and a project's `Deadline`, a recurrence anchor — stores UTC plus the original timezone, rendered in local time only at display. This protects DST correctness now and feeds last-write-wins reconciliation later.

Per-type specifics:

- **Completion is a nullable `CompletedAt`, not a boolean.** `IsCompleted` is a derived read-only property (true once `CompletedAt` is set), on both `TaskItem` and `Project`.
- **Two optional date fields.** `Deadline` is the hard due date (the default workflow uses only this). `When` is the scheduled date that drives Today/Upcoming, with three stored states: unscheduled, a concrete (zoned) date, or Someday. "Today" and "This Evening" are not stored states — the caller stamps the current day in the user's timezone as a concrete date, "This Evening" adding an evening flag. Whether something is today / upcoming / overdue is view logic comparing the stored date to the current day, never a stored flag.
- **Recurrence** is an RFC 5545 RRULE string plus a zoned anchor. Computing the next occurrence — and advancing a completed task's When to the next cycle — is deferred to the store/logic layer; the domain only holds the rule and anchor.
- **Priority** is an explicit enum: `None`, `P1`, `P2`, `P3`, `P4` (P1 most urgent), default `None`.
- **Sub-tasks** are full `TaskItem` records linked by `ParentTaskId`, not a lightweight checklist, so each carries its own dates, labels, priority, and recurrence.
- **`SortOrder`** on every manually-ordered entity (tasks, projects, sections, labels) is a LexoRank-style fractional string rank, so a new rank always fits between two neighbors without renumbering. The store/rank service assigns it.

Domain types are pure data holders with no clock or persistence access: they never self-stamp `UpdatedAt` — that is the store's job on save.
 
## Storage layer
 
- `ITaskStore` exposes GetAll, Get(id), Save(record), Delete(id). Every data mutation in the app goes through this single interface. This is what makes sync additive later.
- Folder layout uses type-based subfolders: `tasks/`, `projects/`, `sections/`, `labels/`, and `meta/` for settings and schema version. Each file is named `{guid}.json`, so the filename equals the record Id and records are never renamed (which minimizes the sync conflict surface).
- The root folder path is a configuration value, never hardcoded. The v1 default is the local app data path; in a later phase it becomes a cloud-synced folder.
- Save always updates `UpdatedAt`. Delete is a soft delete: set `DeletedAt`, then re-save the record. Never hard-delete a file.
- Use atomic writes: write to a temp file, then swap, so a crash mid-write cannot leave a half-written file. All file IO is async. The temp name carries a unique token (not a fixed `{id}.tmp`) so concurrent saves of one record don't collide, and the writer deletes its own temp on failure.
- Reads are corruption-isolated: `GetAll` skips a file that fails to deserialize (a half-written or partially-synced file) and returns the rest rather than throwing, so one bad file can't break a listing or the index rebuild that runs on it.
## Index layer
 
- `Microsoft.Data.Sqlite`. Rebuild the index from the file folder on startup, then update it incrementally on each Save and Delete.
- The index must hold nothing that cannot be reconstructed from the files. Deleting the index file and restarting must fully rebuild it from the folder. Treat passing this test as a hard requirement.
- Tombstoned records (non-null `DeletedAt`) are excluded from default queries.
- Implementation: `SqliteTaskIndex` (raw SQL) holds the query surface, and `IndexedTaskStore` composes a `FileTaskStore` with it so there is exactly one write path — Save/Delete write the file first, then reflect that one record into the index. `OpenAsync` wires both and rebuilds at startup. By-id and GetAll reads come from the files; all *list* reads come from the index (`ITaskIndex`), which returns the lightweight `TaskListItem` projection and never scans the folder.
- The index database path is configured separately from the data root (`FileTaskStoreOptions.IndexPath`, defaulting to `{RootPath}/index.db`). Because the index is a per-device disposable cache, it must stay on local storage and never be synced: when the data `RootPath` later points at a cloud folder, set `IndexPath` to a local path so the database is never swept into sync (which would spawn per-device conflict copies).
- Queries split on two axes. Classification: by project, by section, by label, and the project-less Inbox. Time: Today (an open task whose When day is today-or-earlier, or whose Deadline is today-or-earlier — so a deadline-only task that is due or overdue still surfaces; overdue rolls forward), This Evening (the evening-flagged subset of the OnDate part of Today), Upcoming (a future When day or a future Deadline), Anytime (Unscheduled and open), Someday, Logbook (completed). The two axes overlap intentionally (e.g. a deadline-only future task is both Anytime and Upcoming).
- Time views are never stored. The current day is computed at query time from an injected `TimeProvider` and time zone and compared against each task's pinned calendar date, which is what makes overdue items carry into Today and a task move Upcoming → Today as the clock advances.
- Deferred (decide when the consuming step lands, not now): (a) live lists of Project/Section/Label for the left-nav should be served by *indexing* those types and excluding tombstones/archived/completed — not by folder-scanning `GetAll` and filtering. (b) Project/Section delete needs cascade semantics (reassign orphaned tasks to Inbox vs. cascade soft-delete); decide when delete is built. (c) Cross-zone "today": a task's `when_date`/`deadline_date` is its calendar day in its own zone, while "today" is computed in the index's zone, so a task pinned in another zone (travel) can be a day off at the boundary — accepted foundation-phase edge; the UTC+zone data needed to refine it later is already retained. (d) File→index writes are not one transaction; a reflect failure leaves the file ahead until the next startup rebuild heals it (the reflect runs in its own SQLite transaction, so the index is never half-written). A persisted dirty-marker, not a retry, is the right future mitigation.
## Parser
 
- `IDateParser` wraps `Microsoft.Recognizers.Text.DateTime` configured with `Culture.Korean`. Input is one line of user text; output is an optional recognized date/time plus the cleaned title with the date text removed.
- Korean is partial support in the library. Keep a small refinement layer that can add rules for common Korean expressions the library misses. Core recognition stays in the library; the boost layer plugs in around it.
- If no date is recognized, use the full text as the title and leave the due date empty. Never crash on ambiguous input.
- The parser is a pure service with no UI or storage dependency. Cover representative expressions with unit tests.
## UI
 
- MVVM with `CommunityToolkit.Mvvm` source generators.
- Interface and interaction references: Things 3 and Todoist. Take the calm hierarchy, restraint, and list interactions from Things 3 (the Project to Section to Task layout, the satisfying complete interaction, generous whitespace), and the fast capture and organization patterns from Todoist (one-line quick-add, filters and saved views, priority cues). These define what the layout and interactions are.
- Quality bar: the files-community Files app. The interface references above define what the layout is; the Files app defines how finished it must feel. Match its native Fluent polish and microinteraction quality. Use Mica/Acrylic materials, native composition animations, and `ItemsRepeater`-based virtualization so long lists scroll smoothly. Native virtualization is the foundation of Files-grade smoothness.
- Light and dark come from the template defaults. Color, spacing, and motion details are intentionally not fixed yet. Leave them adjustable and do not lock them in early.
## Invariants (do not violate)
 
1. Files are the source of truth; SQLite is a disposable index that is always rebuildable from the files.
2. Never sync or treat a monolithic database file as the truth.
3. One file per record, and the filename equals the record GUID.
4. All mutations go through `ITaskStore`.
5. Soft delete only via `DeletedAt`. Never hard-delete.
6. Every record carries Id, CreatedAt, UpdatedAt, DeletedAt, and SchemaVersion.
7. Every user-chosen scheduled date (task When/Deadline, project Deadline, recurrence anchor) is stored as UTC plus original timezone; system timestamps (CreatedAt/UpdatedAt/CompletedAt) are UTC instants only.
8. Domain types have no persistence knowledge, and are pure data holders: they never self-stamp UpdatedAt or read the clock — the store does on save.
9. Dependencies point top-down only: View, ViewModel, Store, files/index.
10. Do not introduce CRDTs or a server backend. The planned sync is cloud-folder plus last-write-wins, not collaborative editing.
## Gotchas
 
- The first successful run must be `dotnet run` or `winapp run` before using F5 or the debugger. The debugger looks for an executable that does not exist until the first run produces it.
- If a build fails showing only MSB3073, the real XAML compile error may be hidden. Read the full `dotnet build` output.
- Cloud sync (future): cloud providers may keep files as on-demand placeholders, so hydrate a file before reading it. FileSystemWatcher can miss or duplicate events over cloud-synced folders, so combine it with a periodic reconcile and a reconcile-on-focus pass rather than trusting events alone.
## Future work (the foundation already accommodates these)
 
- Multi-device sync: point the Store root folder at a OneDrive or Google Drive synced folder, then add a folder watcher and conflict-copy reconciliation (last-write-wins by `UpdatedAt`, honoring tombstones). This is additive because the Store already speaks files.
- Files-grade microinteraction and material polish.
- Reminders via `AppNotifications`. Scheduled reminders while the app is closed require package identity plus a background task or the Windows Task Scheduler.
- Packaging and distribution via `winapp pack`, moving from unpackaged to a direct installer or MSIX as needed.
